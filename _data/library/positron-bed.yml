  A 24V, 100W heat bed in a tiny printer! Insane performance and produced by LDO motors. Glass beds for Lemontron &
  Positron exist, but they are more expensive and not convenient like the magnetic plates.

  Positron community member **Sample Name** has done most of the hard core engineering work on the Positron heat beds.
