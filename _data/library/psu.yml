  The following substitute PSU's also work: LOP-300-27, LOP-200-24, LOP-200-24.
  LOP and EPP variants are dimensionally quite similar.
  
  If you are converting a JourneyMaker, you _can_ re-use the EPP-200-24 PSU. However, the transformers tend to be installed sloppily at a slant, which
  requires snipping off the top of the plastic casing to allow the top plates to sit flush.
