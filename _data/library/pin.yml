  It has been reported that these pins have bad tolerance and can be too thick, but if you chuck a long M3 screw in a
  drill and put a pin on it, you can shave off a bit of material with sandpaper. Surprisingly this method works well!
  
  You can use the same method on the brass insert to make it into a pin. You don't really need to buy this.
