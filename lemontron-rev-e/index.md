Rev E builds on the previous Lemontrons with the Endgame Lemonstruder, the final design with a 4.5:1 gear reduction +
100% PTFE filament path, a relocated tensioner unlocking extra rigidity, quad fans that are also bigger, a wraparound
tool head, and _hundreds_ of other tiny tweaks improving fitment, further shaving the BOM, and increased
rigidity throughout.

## Difficulty

The printing skill level either requires a recent enclosed printer or incredible skill by the operator! These tolerances
are tight and print quality must be high.

## Required Tools

### Screw Drivers

As for screws, only M3 (2mm Hex Bit) and a few M2.5 are used. I recommend having a dedicated high quality 2mm hex screwdriver, plus a bit for your drill.

### 3D Printing Tools

You will need a modern, enclosed 3D printer to print the Lemontron parts. Razors for scraping. A craft knife for tidying
blemishes. Supa glue for the Lemonstruder parts (the "liquid" one not the thick one).

### Electrical Tools

A soldering iron is needed for soldering the edge connector and other wires. For the
motors, you'll need some wire cutters and a crimper. You may try your luck with a soldering iron.

### Trimming Tools

The motor shafts and X-Axis rail must be shortened. A Dremel with a cutoff wheel is recommended. Flush cutters are also
required, but 3d printers tend to come with those.
