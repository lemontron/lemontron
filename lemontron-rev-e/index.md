{% include tip.html
title = "What you see here is a work in progress!"
tip = "All this content is basically just hype for Rev E, not a complete documentation. The build guide doesn't even
exist!" %}

Rev E builds on the previous Lemontrons with the Endgame Lemonstruder, the final complete extrusion system with a 4.5:
1 gear reduction + 100% PTFE filament path, a relocated tensioner unlocking extra rigidity, quad fans that are also
bigger, a wraparound tool head, and _hundreds_ of other tiny tweaks improving fitment, further shaving the BOM, and
increased rigidity throughout.

## Printing difficulty: Level 10

This bad boy requires a recent enclosed printer or tuning that's considered perfection-seeking! These
tolerances are tight and print quality _must_ be off-the-charts high. As for the actual assembly, the difficulty is much
more forgiving-- the tools are common and the build process is extremely rewarding.

## Required Tools

### Screw Drivers

As for screws, only M3 (2mm Hex Bit) and a few M2.5 are used. I recommend having a dedicated high quality 2mm hex
screwdriver, plus a bit for your drill.

### 3D Printing Tools

You will need a modern, enclosed 3D printer to print the Lemontron parts. Razors for scraping. A craft knife for tidying
blemishes. Supa glue for the Lemonstruder parts (the "liquid" one not the thick one).

### Electrical Tools

A soldering iron is needed for soldering the edge connector and other wires. For the
motors, you'll need some wire cutters and a crimper. You may try your luck with a soldering iron.

### Trimming Tools

The motor shafts and X-Axis rail must be shortened. A Dremel with a cutoff wheel is recommended. Flush cutters are also
required, but 3d printers tend to come with those.
