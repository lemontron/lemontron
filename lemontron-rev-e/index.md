Rev E builds on the previous Lemontrons with the Endgame Lemonstruder, the final complete extrusion system with a 4.5:
1 gear reduction + 100% PTFE filament path, a relocated tensioner unlocking extra rigidity, new quad fans for 8x cooling over Rev A, a wraparound tool head, and _hundreds_ of other tiny tweaks improving fitment, further shaving the BOM, and
increased rigidity throughout.
