One of the screws in the extruder motor is replaced with a M3 x 25mm wafer head! The screw sticks out and onto it you
place a medium shim and this pin. This holds the 72 tooth gear.

It has been reported that these pins have bad tolerance and can be too thick, but if you chuck a long M3 screw in a
drill and put a pin on it, you can shave off a bit of material with sandpaper. Surprisingly this method works well!
