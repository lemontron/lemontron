A 5015 fan is used as a part cooling fan. The designation 5015 refers to the fanâ€™s overall dimensions; 50mm wide and
15mm thick. It's a blower fan, meaning it directs air perpendicular to the intake. Different from an axial fan, which
pushes air straight through the fan. The blower design allows the 5015 fan to provide high static pressure, making it
effective at pushing air through confined spaces or over specific components, such as the hot end in the Lemontron.

Importantly, West3D sales a much faster and stronger version of the 5015 fan, the _Berserker Vindr Ultra-Performance
5015 Blower Fan 24V 5015B-24V-A 50x15mm_. If this will ship to your country, it's strongly recommended!

I've removed the links to the previous fans, as they were too weak!
