title: Belt is rubbing on left top plate
---

Your left top plate is bowed due to extruder/bed wires trapped underneath.

1. Make sure you've bound your wires in kapton tape.
2. Use the wire from the BOM, they are especially thin!
3. Loosen the top and mid-plates and give the wire bundle a good wank to settle it into the wire channels
