title: Belt is rubbing on right top plate
---
1. The wires in the PSU cavity are too springy or your have a clearance issue and are pushing the top plate up. Redo the wiring so that it's cleaner.
2. Some non-MeanWell, alternate PSU's such as from AME, have a taller capacitor. Carve out your top plate.
