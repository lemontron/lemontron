title: M3 Screws are not passing through the holes properly
---
This problem is caused by overextrusion on the printed parts. Holes will be sized too small and this makes assembly
harder. Unfortunately, you'll need to tune up the printer you're printing with. Calibrate the flow rate and reprint the
affected parts.
