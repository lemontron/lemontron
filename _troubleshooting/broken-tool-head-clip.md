title: The tool head clip broke and the belt popped out
---

1. Reprint it in plain old PETG or PLA (but not silk PLA, matte PLA is not ideal either). Both plastics have excellent layer adhesion. 
2. This time, push the belt all the way in so that it bottoms out. If the belt isn't pushed all the way in, the clip has no strength and will fail.
