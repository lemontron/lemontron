        <h1>Me</h1>
        <p>
            I’m James. I’ve been developing a 3D printer that powerful as it is portable. It fits neatly into
            a standard filament box, breaking boundaries and making it the perfect tool for makers on the go.

    <h1>Support Me</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Get your name in the videos by supporting me.</b> It's so important to back makers like me, so we can keep making cool
        stuff and videos for you guys. I personally back other makers, and you should to!
