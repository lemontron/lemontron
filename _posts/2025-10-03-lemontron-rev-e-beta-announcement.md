Rev E builds on the previous versions of Lemontron:

1. **"Endgame Lemonstruder"** - 4.5:1 gear reduction + 100% PTFE filament path
2. **New Tensioner** - Unlocking extra rigidity
3. **Quad Fans** - Potentially up to 16x more chassis cooling?!
4. **Wraparound Tool Head** - A radical new cooling design for amazing overhang performance
5. Literally _hundreds_ of other tiny tweaks improving fitment, further shaving the BOM, and increased rigidity
   throughout

It's time for a few brave souls to sign up for the beta! For those
interested, what I have for you is a pre-plated Bambu Studio project, all the 3MF's, all the CAD, and a complete BOM.
What I don't have for you is...instructions. The beta is only available to experienced builders.

In preparation for Rev E, I've completely overhauled the website, opting to host the documentation for Rev A-D and Rev
E! To do this, I've implemented a Library of BOM items, so my different projects can reference those items. A cool setup
indeed!

All my content (so far, a wip) for Rev E is now live, just click "Build yours" then select Rev E!
