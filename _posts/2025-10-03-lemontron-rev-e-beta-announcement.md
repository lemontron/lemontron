## What's new?

Lemontron Rev E builds on the previous versions of Lemontron:

1. **"Endgame Lemonstruder"** - 4.5:1 gear reduction + 100% PTFE filament path (not the same as the beta that's out
   now!)
2. **Relocated Tensioner** - Unlocking extra rigidity
3. **Quad Fans** - Potentially up to 16x more chassis cooling?!
4. **Wraparound Tool Head** - A radical new cooling design for amazing overhang performance
5. Literally _hundreds_ of other tiny tweaks improving fitment, further shaving the BOM, and increased rigidity
   throughout

## So then it's ready, right?

The best thing would be to release everything at once-- docs, images, video, etc. This is way too much for me, so since
the CAD & BOM is ready, it would be a shame to not let people take advantage of that. For those
interested, what I have for you is a pre-plated Bambu Studio project, all the 3MF's, all the CAD, and a complete BOM.
What I don't have for you is...instructions. The beta is only available to experienced builders.

## "Darn it, I just bought the parts for Rev D"

Good news! As long as you ordered your Endgame Lemonstruder Beta parts, you have all the parts needed to complete the
Rev E build except for the new larger fans.

## New website also

In preparation for Rev E, I've completely overhauled the website, opting to host the documentation for Rev A-D and Rev
E! To do this, I've implemented a Library of BOM items, so my different projects can reference those items. A cool setup
indeed!

## Want to check it out?

All my content (so far, a wip) for Rev E is now live, just click "Build yours" then select Rev E! Just remember, what you see is all that I have so far.
