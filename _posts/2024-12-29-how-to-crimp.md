Hi guys, I personally roll with solder gang but crimps are still the GOAT occasionally. You need to
crimp well to assemble a Lemontron, so here are my tips...

1. **Disable the ratchet!** Let the crimper become a natural extension of your body. The ratchet dulls your sensations.
   Feel the JST connector succumb to your power.
2. **A crimp must BEGIN well to end well.** You can't just barrel through life like some sort of baboon. You have to
   begin gently squeezing the JST and get a feel for it. If it buckles, it's a DUD...abort!
3. **Precision is key:** Expose the tip of the wire, just 1mm for this tiny connector.
4. Insert the wire by feel primarily but **LOOK AT IT WITH YOUR EYES TOO**.
5. **Don't practice on the motors!** You need to just get a feel for it and then you'll be a pro crimper.
