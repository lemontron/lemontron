Lemontron takes the best parts of the JourneyMaker, Positron v3.2, and Positron LT. But why did I wait until the
JourneyMaker was available to get involved with the Positron?

## The Age Before the JourneyMaker

Early in 2023, a video appeared on my YouTube feed—a video that would change everything. Created by user KRALYN, it
showcased a fascinating new printer design: the Positron.

I was captivated by the fundamentals of the design and knew immediately that I wanted one. However, the printer itself
was still in its early stages, unrefined, and required numerous CNC parts that seemed out of reach for me at the time.

## Enter Voxolite

In early 2024, McFazio introduced a new Positron design, elevating the concept into something extraordinary. Dubbed the
“JourneyMaker” for its exceptional portability, McFazio had refined the design to near perfection. He minimized the
number of CNC parts and even founded a company to sell these components, making the JourneyMaker the first purchasable
kit for any Positron printer.

Upon further research, I discovered that McFazio hadn’t merely forked the original Positron design; he had built a
complete redesign from scratch in an entirely different CAD software.

## A Journey's Made

With McFazio’s work, JourneyMaker was a refined and accessible design to build off of. I immediately purchased a
JourneyMaker kit from Voxolite, marking the beginning of my dive into the world of Positrons.

Lemontron started as a mod for the JourneyMaker and quickly grew into another ground-up redesign.

Like the JourneyMaker, the Lemontron is an adventure. A journey that starts as parts, and ends as a printer that is
truly your own.
