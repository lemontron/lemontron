Despite its savage heat, high flow rate, solid engineering & high quality construction, there is one an issue with the Positron 90
hotend! It ships from the factory loose, causing leaking and horrible results before you tighten it up. It's absolutely
imperative that you rebuild the hotend _before_ you use it.
