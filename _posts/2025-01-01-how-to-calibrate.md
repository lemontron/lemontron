Once your Lemontron is assembled, you must do a one-time calibration! This is a very important step to ensure that your
bed mesh has a good starting point. Yes, your bed will change when you're out on the go, but the probe will make up for
any small variations.

All good prints start with a level bed, meaning the bed is almost parallel to the rails. This is a one-time process, you should
only need to do it again if it gets knocked out of alignment.

## Z-offset calibration

With a levelled bed, you can calibrate the Z offset. This is known as the distance between the probe tip and the
nozzle tip, and is needed to position the nozzle correctly. Many issues can be traced back to an incorrect Z offset!

<ol class="steps">
{% include step.html
title="Home the bed again"
image="calibration---home.png"
content="Click the home button. This will leave the nozzle in the center of the build plate."
%}

{% include step.html
title="Place the paper again"
image="calibration---paper-front.jpg"
content="Place the paper between the nozzle and the bed."
%}

{% include step.html
title="Set z-offset"
image="calibration---z-offset.png"
content="Use the Z offset buttons in the UI to finely adjust the bed up or down so that the paper
just barely drags."
%}

{% include step.html
title="Save"
image="calibration---save.png"
content="Press the save icon. This will lock in your Z offset, which is the distance between the probe tip and nozzle
tip."
%}
</ol>

Your Lemontron is now calibrated and ready to print. You should only need to come back and do it again if your Lemontron
gets knocked around or you change the bed, nozzle, or probe.
