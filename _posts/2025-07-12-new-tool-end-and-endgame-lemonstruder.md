Building a Lemontron now? In the past 6 months after the initial release, there are some new developments you have to be aware of to build the latest & greatest Lemontron!

## Is the Lemontron download on Printables up to date?

Mostly, but please print the [Endgame Lemonstruder Beta](https://discord.com/channels/1158982699613163590/1367539640097308857). There is no reason you should build the Lemonstruder from the initial release when the Endgame Lemonstruder exists.

Also, theres a new [Wrap Around Tool Head](https://www.printables.com/model/1304821-wrap-around-cooling-tool-head-for-lemontron) that greatly enhances the cooling performance and has some other wonderful refinements.

## If both things are ready, why aren't the changes just merged into the Lemontron project?

Because it would require 150+ new pictures and I can't do that right now. So please enjoy the new updates right now because there's no point in holding them back.
