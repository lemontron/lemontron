These tools are needed to build the Lemontron. You may already have some of them, but if not, you can buy them
through these Amazon affiliate links!

## Screw Drivers

The Lemontron benefits from deep integration and thus only M3 (2mm Hex Bit) and a few M2.5 are used. I
recommend having a dedicated high quality M3 screwdriver, plus a bit for your drill. Add a countersink bit to clean up
the printed countersinks and to add countersinks to the probe.

## 3D Printing Tools

You will need a modern, enclosed 3D printer to print the Lemontron parts. Razors for scraping. A craft knife for tidying
blemishes. Supa glue for the Lemonstruder parts (the "liquid" one not the thick one). And tape for holding down the
pesky wires.

## Electrical Tools

A soldering iron is needed for soldering the edge connector and other wires. For the
motors, you'll need some wire cutters and a crimper. You may try your luck with a soldering iron.

## Trimming Tools

The motor shafts and X-Axis rail must be shortened. A Dremel with a cutoff wheel is recommended. Flush cutters are also
required, but 3d printers tend to come with those.
