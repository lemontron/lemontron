What you see is the Lemontron Rev E, building on the previous versions of Lemontron with...

1. **Endgame Lemonstruder** with a 4.5:1 gear reduction & 100% PTFE filament path and filament guide for the least
   amount of friction possible!
2. **Relocated tensioner** that unlocks extra rigidity
3. **Quad fans**, potentially up to 16x more chassis cooling?!
4. **Wraparound Tool Head**, a new cooling design for amazing overhang performance
5. Literally _hundreds_ of other tiny tweaks improving fitment, further shaving the BOM, and increased rigidity
   throughout

## "Darn it, I just bought the parts for Rev D"

Good news! As long as you ordered your Endgame Lemonstruder parts, you have all the parts needed to complete the
Rev E build (except for the new larger fans). All you'll have left over is a few screws.

## New website also

In preparation for Rev E, I've completely overhauled the website, opting to host the documentation for Rev A-D and Rev
E! To do this, I've implemented a Library of BOM items, so my different projects can reference those items. A cool setup
indeed!

## Want to check it out?

The BOM for Rev E is final, just click "Build yours" then select Rev E! Just remember, all that content is basically
just hype for Rev E, not a complete documentation. The build guide doesn't even exist.

But for real, DM me and I might send you the files.
